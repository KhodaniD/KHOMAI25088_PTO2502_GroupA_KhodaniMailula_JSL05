# JSL05: Kanban Board Project - Dynamic Task Management System

---

## Project Title

**Kanban Board with Dynamic Task Display & Modal View with Local Storage Persistence and Task Creation**

---

## Project Description

This project develops a foundational Kanban board web application, designed to help users visualize and manage their workflow. It features a **responsive layout** that gracefully adapts to various screen sizes, organizing tasks into "TODO," "DOING," and "DONE" columns.

Building upon a static visual base, this version introduces a **JavaScript-driven system for dynamic task display and interactive management directly on the DOM**. Users can now **add new tasks** via a dedicated button, and **click on existing tasks to open a modal** where they can view, **modify**, or **delete** task details. The system emphasizes a seamless user experience with real-time updates to the board, ensuring tasks are always displayed in their correct columns. Crucially, all task data **persists in local storage**, meaning your progress is saved even if you close the browser. This project showcases robust DOM manipulation, event handling, and a clean, modular JavaScript architecture for a professional and scalable implementation, including **custom input validation** for a guided user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Provides the structural backbone for the web page content and elements, including semantic tags and placeholders for dynamic content.
* **CSS3**: Handles the application's styling, including layout, typography, colors, and comprehensive responsive design for various screen sizes.
    * **CSS Variables**: Utilized to define a flexible color palette, simplifying theme management and ensuring consistency.
    * **Flexbox**: Employed for responsive layout of various components, ensuring flexible arrangement and alignment.
    * **CSS Grid**: Used for arranging the main Kanban columns in a structured and adaptive manner.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Powers all dynamic behavior, including task rendering, event handling, and interactive modal management.
    * **DOM Manipulation**: Extensively used to create, append, update, and remove HTML elements dynamically.
    * **Event Handling**: Manages user interactions such as clicks on tasks, modal buttons, and the mobile header for sidebar toggling.
    * **Modular Structure**: Code is organized into single-responsibility functions for clarity and maintainability (e.g., `main.js` for bootstrapping, `tasks.js` for state management, `modal.js` for UI interactions, `storage.js` for data persistence).
    * **Array Manipulation**: Fundamental for efficiently storing, adding, updating, and filtering task objects in memory.
    * **Local Storage API**: Used to persist task data across browser sessions.
    * **Custom Input Validation**: Implemented for key input fields to provide immediate user feedback.
* **Google Fonts**: Specifically, 'Plus Jakarta Sans', ensures consistent and modern typography throughout the application.

## Features Created and Updated

### Core Features:

* **Responsive Layout**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Kanban Columns**: Tasks are dynamically generated and placed into "TODO," "DOING," and "DONE" columns based on their status, with real-time updates to task counts.
* **No Hard-Coded Tasks**: All tasks are dynamically generated from JavaScript data, ensuring no hard-coded task content remains in the HTML.
* **Desktop Sidebar**: A persistent navigation sidebar on larger screens for board selection.
* **Mobile-Optimized Header**: A compact header designed for mobile devices, displaying the Kanban logo and the current board title. **Clicking this header will toggle the visibility of the sidebar on mobile.**
* **Themed Styling**: Uses CSS variables for a clean, light theme, making visual modifications straightforward.
* **Typography Management**: Ensures consistent font styling across the application via Google Fonts integration and specific CSS rules, including precise modal typography.

### Updates & Enhancements:

* **Interactive Modal-Based Task Management**:
    * **"Add New Task" Modal**: A dedicated button in the header opens a modal for creating new tasks.
    * **"Edit Task" Modal**: Clicking an existing task opens a modal pre-filled with its current details.
    * **Editable Fields**: Both modals feature editable input fields for task `title` and `description`.
    * **Status Dropdown**: A `select` dropdown displays the current `status` and allows users to easily change it to "todo", "doing", or "done".
    * **Save Changes**: A "Save Changes" button updates the task's details and status, instantly reflecting changes on the board.
    * **Delete Task**: An option to "Delete Task" is available in the edit modal, removing the task from the board.
    * **Clear Close Button**: A prominent 'X' button allows users to easily close the modal without saving changes.
    * **Backdrop Effect**: The modal includes a semi-transparent backdrop to focus user attention on its content.

* **Data Persistence**:
    * All task data is automatically saved to and loaded from **Local Storage**, ensuring tasks are preserved across browser sessions.

* **Input Validation**:
    * Custom validation messages are implemented for the task title input field, guiding users to fill out required fields.

* **Code Quality & Maintainability**:
    * **Modular JavaScript**: Code is structured into single-responsibility functions (e.g., `renderTasks`, `openTaskModal`, `addNewTask`, `updateTaskState`, `deleteTask`), enhancing readability and maintainability.
    * **Descriptive Naming Conventions**: All variables, functions, and elements are named clearly and meaningfully, making the codebase immediately understandable.
    * **JSDoc Comments**: Every major function and module is thoroughly documented with JSDoc comments, including descriptions, parameters, and return values, ensuring self-documented and easily understandable code.
